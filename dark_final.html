		As the title suggests, this is the final chapter of the famous Dark-series.
		Features three unique ways built from the ground up as well as three remakes of the older classic hard ways from each Dark map.

		I never thought I would work on this map if I’m being honest.
		And I never would have if it weren’t for Toxic and his interest in finishing this “relic”. At the start I only helped him with a few different things to get him started.
		But then it turned into helping him a lot and doing significant parts of the map.
		</p>
		<p>
		A lot of the map was made by kie, the original creator of the Dark-series, back in 2015.
		The basis of the easy, easy-hard, hard and the dark1 remake were all done by kie alone with only a handful of people testing them.
		However he lost interest and the project files themselves sometime after that, resulting in him being unable to finish the map.
		</p>
		<p>
		After Toxic expressed interest in wanting to finish the project, I contacted kie to ask him if this was fine for him, and non-surprisingly he agreed since the project was already gone at that point.
		However, we still had the compiled fast files for the map, which allowed me to use <a style="color: white;" href="https://xoxor4d.github.io/projects/iw3xo/" target="_blank">xoxor4d’s tool</a> to convert the map into an editable .map project files.
		Those needed to be fixed and in some parts reconstructed, since r4d’s tool is not perfect and tends to leave some brushes out.
		I sent the project files to Toxic and he did most of this clean-up work.
		</p>
		<p>
		During this time, I thought it would be a cool idea to introduce a remake of mp_dark_v2’s hard way, but with the design of mp_dark_v3 hard way, because the original design of dark_v2 always felt a bit like an outlier to me.
		It is even rumored to have originally been an entirely different map, only changed to dark_v2 at the end because of the success of the original mp_dark.
		With the same method as above, I converted dark_v2 into a .map file, so I could get a base from where to work on.
		I did everything from jumps, to design, to lighting, to testing, although NoobAim did help with the testing a bit.
		And since it was a remake, the jumps resembled the original map quite a bit.
		</p>
		<p>
		Toxic also wanted to have a third remake, the very famous hard way of dark_v3. The same thing was done again, converting the map into a workable project and modifying it.
		Although unlike other remakes, this remake was done very last minute and was left as just a tweaked version of the original map.
		When the preview video was made for this map a few days before release, the dark_v3 remake didn’t even exist yet.
		It’s hard to spot the differences unless you were very familiar with the original map. It’s more of a remaster than a remake.
		</p>
		<p>
		While this map is probably not what kie had originally envisioned, we hope with Toxic that it at least meets some of the expectation and excitement for the map.
		We tried really hard to stay true to the design principles of the Dark-series, to stay as authentic as possible, gauging every decision carefully.
		We didn’t want to ruin the important legacy of the Dark-series, by making some rushed sequel just because it would be popular.
		</p>
		<p>
		We had a lot of well-known jumpers of the community to test and critique the map and we believe that their feedback molded the map into what it is today.
		Also the two extra remakes, while nothing groundbreaking, still serve a purpose by bringing more variety and value to the map.

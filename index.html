		A map from the community, to the community. Started a long time ago, as two seperate maps, both from different creators.

		A small single way map set in a neon retrowave city. Filled with interesting secrets and opportunities for experienced jumpers.
		Inspired by themes of retrofuturism and 80s influenced synthwave music from artists such as Carpenter Brut and Perturbator.

		As it is my first ever publicly released map, its scope is rather unambitious, leaving a lot of to be desired compared to some of the more well-rounded maps in CoDJumper.
		It is not a very accessible map either, having only one fairly difficult way. This was never meant to be a statement in grand mapping/jumping design.
		It was simply a product of my inspiration coming from music and other media at the time.
		</p>
		<p>
		Difficulty of the map is designed to be around 13-14/20, assuming you do every intended jump.
		Most of the jumps are straight-forward and very forgiving, however, there are some that might seem a bit ridiculous at first.
		Either way it is recommended that you have had experience in finishing some hard-ways in CoDJumper before giving this map a proper try, as it is a map that is aimed at experienced jumpers.
		</p>
		<p>
		The map is very non-linear in a sense that it loops back around to previously been areas, allowing potential for shortcuts and other miscellanious extra jumps.
		The goal was to create a map that had a “route”, but would also work as a freeroam map if wanted to play that way.
		The map encourages exploration and works also as a “playground” of some sort. The intended hybrid design fit well with the city design concept and also extends the replayability value of the map.
		</p>
		<p>
		Strobe was developed during a period of three months, culminating in the release of the map back in September of 2017.
		It was my first ever publicly released map, though at the time I had already been mapping for over 1,5 years.
		</p>
		<p>
		The map doesn’t make use of any incredibly advanced mapping techniques.
		It does however do some out-of-the ordinary things, such as clever use of custom textures and pretty advanced lighting.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the end, Strobe turned out to be a very polarising map, some people loving it and some people hating it.
		Either way, it was an important stepping-stone for me as a mapper as I learned a ton of things while creating it.
		There are of course obvious issues and you could argue that the hybrid design doesn’t really work as well as I had planned. These might be addressed in a potential update in the future.

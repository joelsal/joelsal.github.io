		A modest single way map set in a neon retrowave-themed city.
		Filled with interesting secrets and opportunities for experienced jumpers.
		Inspired by 80s influenced aesthetics of retrofuturism, outrun and synthwave.

		As it is my first ever publicly released map, its scope is rather unambitious, leaving a lot to be desired compared to some of the more well-rounded maps in CoDJumper.
		It is not a very accessible map either, having only one fairly difficult way.
		This was never meant to be a statement in grand mapping/jumping design.
		It was simply a product of my inspiration coming from music and other media at the time.

		In terms of difficulty, the map is designed to sit around 13-14/20 assuming you do every single intended jump.
		Most of the map is pretty straight-forward and forgiving, however, there are some jumps that might seem a bit ridiculous at first.
		Because of this, it is recommended that you have had at least some experience in finishing hard-ways before giving this map a proper try, as it is a map that was aimed at experienced jumpers.

		The map is very non-linear in a sense that it loops back around to previously been areas, allowing potential for shortcuts and other miscellanious extra jumps.
		The goal was to create a map that had a “route”, but would also work as a freeroam map if wanted to play that way.
		The map encourages exploration and works also as a “playground” of some sort.
		The intended hybrid design fit well with the city design concept and also extends the replayability value of the map.

		This map started as a little pet project, but funnily enough turned out to be the first map I would ever release.
		It was developed during a period of three months, culminating in the release of the map back in September of 2017.

		The entire map is illuminated by light entities, meaning it has no real sunlight like most maps do.
		This was done to make the map appear to have been set during nighttime, which is surprisingly hard to do.
		No matter how much the sun settings were tweaked, it would always end up looking like daytime.
		The solution was to outright disable parts of the sun by modifying the skybox settings
		which resulted in a very dark aesthetic while also still keeping some parts of the world lit up like the player viewmodels for example.
		This whole setup caused a lot of weird issues and bugs that took sometime to get fixed (some still haven't).

		In the end, Strobe turned out to be a very polarising map, some people loving it and some people hating it.
		Either way, it was an important stepping-stone for me as a mapper as I learned a ton of things while creating it.
		There are of course obvious issues and you could argue that the hybrid design doesn’t really work as well as I had planned. These might be addressed in a potential update in the future.
